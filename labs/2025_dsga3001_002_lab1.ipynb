It is not a good idea to use it when *training* an agent because rendering slows down training a lot. But when looking at an environment for the first time, or when training is complete, it can of course be useful to graphically vizualize how the agent behaves in the environment. But here is the warning: in Jupyter Notebook the Gym's graphical rendering works well but is likely to crash your kernel (or freeze it) once the simulation is complete. So as a habit, be ready to click on `Interrupt` and `Restart` in the Kernel tab of Jupyter Notebook after you run a simulation rendered graphically."
