    "## Goal of Today's Lab \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we will implement RL algorithms by building on existing RL algorithm libraries, so we don't have to implement RL agents from scratch as we did in the past few weeks. By doing so, we get less control on the details of the implementation, but it is much faster to implement (**we will cover 4 case studies today:** `CartPole`, `SpaceInvaders`, `CarRacing`, and `StockTrading`), and components available in public libraries tend to be high quality and efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with the DQN algorithm. We can use external open-source Python packages which implement each of the key DQN methods (e,g., experience replay method, action-selection method, etc). These methods are developed, maintained, and optimized for robustness to different scenarios, and for overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these packages instead of implementing each DQN component from scratch is generally faster, leads to a more reliable/efficient program, yet still gives you a lot of control on the details of the implementation and hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on DQN in the first part of the lab, but these packages also offer methods for most commonly used RL algorithms such as A3C, PPO, etc, so we will start looking at these too.\n",

    "\n",
    "Keras-RL is an older reinforcement learning library that does not support the latest versions of TensorFlow and Gym. To ensure compatibility, we need to downgrade both TensorFlow and Gym to specific versions that work with Keras-RL.\n",

    "\n",
    "To install the required versions, run the following commands:\n",
